### Notes on Regular Expressions:
The current regular expressions are designed for exact matching, meaning they will only extract the specified values. If you need to handle variable data, you would need to adjust the regex patterns to be more flexible. For example:

- To match **any email address**, you could use:
  ```python
  r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b"
  ```

- To match **any URL**, you could use:
  ```python
  r"https?://(?:[-\w.]|(?:%[\da-fA-F]{2}))+"
  ```

- To match **phone numbers** (with optional area codes, etc.), you could use:
  ```python
  r"\(?\d{3}\)?[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}"
  ```

- To match **credit card numbers** (in common formats), you could use:
  ```python
  r"\b(?:\d{4}[-\s]?\d{4}[-\s]?\d{4}[-\s]?\d{4}|\d{16})\b"
  ```
